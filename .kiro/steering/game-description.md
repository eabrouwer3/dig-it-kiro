# Dig Dug Explanation

## Core Concept:
- A single player controls a character who digs through underground dirt to eliminate enemies by inflating them until they pop or by crushing them with falling rocks.

## Player Character:
- Moves in four directions through dirt, creating tunnels.
- Can fire a short-range “pump” in the direction faced to latch onto an enemy.
- Holding the pump inflates the enemy; continued pumping defeats it.

## Enemies:
- Pooka: Round, red enemies that move through tunnels.
- Fygar: Green dragon enemies that can breathe horizontal fire.

## Enemy Behaviors:
- Move through existing tunnels or “ghost” through dirt slowly to reach the player.
- Increase aggressiveness as time passes.
- Some (Fygar) periodically attack with directional fire.

## Environment:
- Dirt blocks fill the screen; player movement removes them, forming tunnels.
- Rocks positioned in the dirt can be dislodged by digging beneath them; after a brief delay they fall straight down.
- Rocks crush enemies (or the player) if they fall onto them.

## Scoring / Progression:
- Defeat all enemies to clear the level.
- Optional bonuses for crushing multiple enemies with one rock.
- Levels increase enemy count and speed.

## Win/Loss Conditions:
- Level ends when all enemies are defeated.
- Player loses a life if touched by an enemy, hit by fire, or crushed by a rock.
